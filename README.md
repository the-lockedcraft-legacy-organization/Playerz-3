# Description
A highly customizable player list for spigot and bungee.

## Background
- PlayerZ is a bukkit plugin created by C_Kin for Bukkit some time before 2015 (v1).
- After having been dropped abandoned by C_Kin, the plugin was re-uploaded to spigot by BrettPlayMC
- At some point after that, the plugin was forked by Struck713 to add support for newer versions and BungeeCord (v2).
- Some time after 2017, the bungeecord features of v2 stopped functioning.
- This is a private fork from the LCLO to attempt to resolve that issue.
